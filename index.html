            The replacement of natural lands with urban structures has multiple environmental consequences, yet little is known about the magnitude and extent of albedo-induced warming contributions from urbanization at the global scale in the past and future. Here, we apply an empirical approach to quantify the climate effects of past urbanization and future urbanization projected under different shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). We find an albedo-induced warming effect of urbanization for both the past and the projected futures under three illustrative scenarios. The albedo decease from urbanization in 2018 relative to 2001 has yielded a 100-year average annual global warming of 0.00014 [0.00008, 0.00021] °C. Without proper mitigation, future urbanization in 2050 relative to 2018 and that in 2100 relative to 2018 under the intermediate emission scenario (SSP2-4.5) would yield a 100-year average warming effect of 0.00107 [0.00057,0.00179] °C and 0.00152 [0.00078,0.00259] °C, respectively, through altering the Earth’s albedo.

        <p>Urbanization-induced land use and land cover change (LULCC) is one of the most phenomenal changes across the terrestrial surface of the Earth, especially in recent decades. According to the MODIS land use land cover product, the global urban land was 0.79 million km2 in 2018, and by 2050, 68% of the world population is expected to reside in urban areas1, resulting in a forecasted urban land of 1.04–1.90 million km2 2,3,4. These shifts will fundamentally change physical properties of the land surface, which in turn will alter the surface energy balance, hydrological cycle, and biogeochemical processes, inducing a series of environmental and climate consequences5,6,7,8.

            Anthropogenic LULCC, including urbanization defined as the expansion of urban land here, affects local-to-global climate not only through modifications in surface roughness, carbon processes, and turbulent heat fluxes, but also through changes in surface albedo that directly alter the Earth’s radiation budget9. However, most of the attention thus far has been focused on quantifying changes in carbon processes10,11,12,13,14, with less known about albedo changes caused by LULCC and the associated climate impact9,15,16,17,18. Collectively, for all forms of LULCC, Ghimire et al. reported that global albedo changes during 1700–2005 were responsible for a negative radiative forcing (RF) of −0.15 ± 0.10 W/m217. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), on the other hand, estimated a RF of −0.2 ± 0.2 W/m2 for albedo changes caused by LULCC relative to 1750, but with medium-low confidence, suggesting a need for more robust research in this area9. The insufficient understanding of the albedo-induced climate effect due to LULCC has recently triggered a lot of interest in climate forcing of albedo changes due to deforestation/afforestation, because forests cover a large portion of land surfaces and are promoted as a leading nature-based solution for climate change mitigation6,19,20,21. Unfortunately, very limited efforts have been made to study the climate effects of albedo change induced by urbanization, one of the most important LULCC processes that is mainly caused by human activities.

                Past work quantifying the albedo consequences of global LULCC mostly used very coarse-gridded climate models (i.e., coarser than 2° spatial resolution), where the unique contribution from urbanization was not discernible because the small proportion of urban area was either assumed to be a constant through time or not properly represented18,21,22. We argue that the aggregated impacts of urbanization at regional-to-global scales are not negligible even though urban lands occupy only a very small proportion of global land surfaces5,7.

                Urbanization-induced albedo changes or manipulating the albedo of urban land have been shown to affect local, regional, and even global climate. Hu et al.23 assessed the surface albedo change in Beijing from 2001 to 2009 caused by urbanization using remote sensing and field measurements. They found a positive relationship between albedo-induced RF and urbanization level and suggested that the cumulative effects of albedo change caused by urbanization could be important drivers of recent local climate change. Zhao et al.24 found empirical evidence that the night-time urban heat island (UHI) intensity and the urban-rural albedo difference are negatively correlated and argued that increasing urban albedo can produce measurable results to mitigate UHI on a large continental scale. There also exist many simulation studies that focus on assessing the global climate effect of modifying urban albedo (i.e., with prescribed albedo changes)25,26,27,28,29. These studies, consistently show cooling effects by increasing urban albedo. However, at the global scale, no study has assessed the climate impact of surface albedo changes due to actual or projected urbanization, i.e., the change of albedo due to replacing other lands with urban lands. Overall, the albedo of urban lands is 0.01–0.02 lower than that of adjacent croplands30, therefore urbanization can potentially have a global warming effect by reducing the Earth's albedo.

            <p>In this study, we aim to understand albedo-induced climate effects for the past (2018–2001) and the projected future (2050 relative to 2018 and 2100 relative to 2018) global urbanization by estimating its RF. We adopted a method used by Ghimire et al.17, which integrates the spatially and temporally explicit albedo product of MODIS31 and the LULCC databases and has yielded results comparable to those of process-based modeling work as summarized in the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report9. Using a similar approach, we estimated the albedo-induced RF of historical urbanization with MODIS land cover product, and of future urbanization with a recently released future urban land projection at 1-km resolution3 under selected shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The albedo-induced RF was then converted to a carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2-eq) metric called global warming potential (GWP), and to global mean temperature response to facilitate interpretation for decision-makers and assure simple comparisons with greenhouse gas effects.

            <p>Large spatial variations in surface albedo changes exist among urban landscapes (grid-level) for historical and future urbanization, which are due to a combination of local climate conditions and land cover composition changes (Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs. 1, 2). The changes in grid-level albedo fall generally between −0.001 and 0.001, because urban areas account for a very small portion of most grids and of the global land surfaces (less than 3% even for the projected more urbanized future in 2100). However, relatively large changes that reach <−0.005 also appear in the near (2050) and far (2100) futures relative to 2018. The areas of declined albedo are mostly in regions that used to and still have a high percentage of croplands and urban lands, including Europe, the Middle East, the east and west coasts of the United States, northern India, the North China Plain, the China Bohai Rim region, and the east coastal area of the Mediterranean Sea. More importantly, the spatial pattern of grids with negative changes in albedo is similar to the global distribution of croplands (Supplementary Fig. 3), suggesting that most urban lands continue to be converted from adjacent croplands2,32,33 that, on average, have higher surface albedo than urban lands (Supplementary Fig. 4). The frequency distribution of global grid-level albedo is left skewed (Fig. 1d), leading to a global mean of reduced albedo that produces positive RF (see Radiative Forcing).
